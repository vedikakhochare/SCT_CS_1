# SCT_CS_1
# Cyber Security Internship Task 01 at SkillCraft Technology.

Creating a program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caeser Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption


# What Does a Caesar Cipher Do?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It works like this:

Each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:

A → D

B → E

C → F

…

X → A

Y → B

Z → C

This way, the message gets scrambled, and anyone without the shift key can’t read it easily.
